### Analyzing Life Expectancy: Insights from World Health Organization Dataset

In this project, I analyzed the factors that impact a country's life expectancy using various techniques such as KNN imputation, preprocessing with pipelines, and machine learning models. The dataset used was provided by the World Health Organization. The main objective was to identify the key metrics that influence life expectancy.
